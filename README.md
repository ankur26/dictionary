### Built with

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - For Bundling.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) - For base components 


### What I learned

1. Component Libraries are very useful when it comes to doing initial base designs but custom things are a bit hard to come along
2. Continued practice of react.

### Continued development

- Bifurcation of components, the component files are too big and too basic.
- Using a store like redux or zustand rather than having pass through props.
